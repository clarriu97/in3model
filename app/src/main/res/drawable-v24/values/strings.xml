    <string name="aboutUsMain">In3 was born in september, 2014 as an idea: what if there was a free access and open hardware incubator published for free on the Internet? Something like that could make local craftsman make their own incubators for premature babies. It would be great, would not be?\nWith this base, Alejandro Escario got down to work. The first prototype was ready for June 2015, as it was Alejandro\'s thesis for his Master in Biomedical Engineering. Months later, this prototype kept evolving and improving lots of the first draft characteristics.</string>
